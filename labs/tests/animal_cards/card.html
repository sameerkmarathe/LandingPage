        <p class="fact">The dog is man's best friend. He has the following attributes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span>Scientific Name</span>: Canis Canidae</li>
          <li><span>Average Weight</span>: 50lbs</li>
          <li><span>Varieties</span>: Over 4,000</li>
          <li><span>Uses</span>: As working dogs (assistants), or general pets, dogs are devoted to their human masters in all situations, and can be trained to do most anything.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A dog is a wonderful companion. If we take the proper steps
        to keep our senior dogs healthy, they can remain active and
        happy well into the equivalent of their 80s or 90s. This is a
        wonderful thing, because senior dogs also tend to be calmer
        and mellower, and less likely to suddenly develop misbehaviors
        or phobias because theyâ€™ve been around longer and have had a
          lot more experience than younger dogs.</p>
